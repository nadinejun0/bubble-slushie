            <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

            <p>I'm a technical, hands-on product owner. I love to go deep and figure things out for myself. Though data-driven, the most human solution often involves collaboration
                 I'm excited to learn more about your Studio tool, and I want to know what business problems you're facing. </p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I have specialized in translating complex business requirements into viable
                technical solutions that drive measurable results. At Prints of Love, I helped scale the company from
                ~$400K to over $10M in annual revenue through strategic technology decisions and customer-focused
                solutions. As Senior Director of Product Design & Development, I led initiatives that increased average
                order value by 8.8% through targeted A/B testing and customer journey optimizations.</p>

            <p>My technical background includes expertise in API integrations, workflow automation, and front-end
                development. I have successfully managed complete site migrations while maintaining data integrity
                across thousands of monthly orders. Additionally, I have implemented automated customer support
                workflows resulting in significant improvements in deflection rates and self-serve content resolution.
            </p>

            <p>What particularly excites me about [Company Name] is [specific aspect of the company's mission,
                technology, or culture that resonates with you]. I believe my combination of technical product
                leadership and practical implementation experience aligns perfectly with the needs outlined in your job
                description.</p>

            <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm would make me a
                valuable addition to your team. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,</p>
